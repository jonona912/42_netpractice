## 💡 About the project

> _Net Practice is an individual project at 42 Wolfsburg designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of computer networking. By solving practical exercises, students gain hands-on experience with subnetting, routing, and troubleshooting within simulated network topologies. This project builds a strong foundation for understanding how networks operate and how data travels across them._

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/jonona912/42_netpractice/blob/main/Net_Practice_subject.pdf).

## 🛠️ Usage
This repo contains solutions to the Net Practice project exercises that were submitted to the 42 network.
